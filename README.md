# GeneAnnotations

## 1. Biomart 
https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-11-294
I have reviewed this paper and Biomart is almoist taking care of updating probe sequence based matching to latest annotations. The only issue could be the number of choips that are annotated by biomart.

## 2. AnnotationDBi

This provides a face to vendor specific db's[probe ids to gene symbols matching].If there are some of them which are remaining from above I can use this to fill the gap above ; 

## 3: Helders lab pipeline 
- https://github.com/csbl-usp/reannotator-microarray-probes/tree/main Helder lab ; reannotator-microarray-probes
  - run it for latest relaese probably we are at 110 now ;
  - But until then just do a quick test with Vanessa's file 



Others:
Dmitri suggested and I also know from Lars thatw e could use brainarray provided cdf etc or vendor specific etc.
